### How can we tell there's interaction between variables?
#### P-values and Interaction plots: <https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interaction-effects/>
#### start with interaction plots and then check significance by conducting stats analysis: <https://stattrek.com/multiple-regression/interaction.aspx>
#### difference among correlation, multicollinearity and interaction
### multicollieanrity is to define the relationship between one predictor and other predictors, to see if they have linear relationship; interaction (mostly categorical variables?) is to see two or more variables, how they influence the result together
