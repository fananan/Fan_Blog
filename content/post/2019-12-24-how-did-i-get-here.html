<h2>The simple workflow to get started with Blogdown</h2>
<p>I always want to start my own blog. I tried Medium because I really liked their simple neat interface, but the only thing it lacks of is the function to let me embed code in my article. Later I found blogdown and got excited to use it, but I almost gave up because I encounted few trivial problems. So I would like to share what I learned through this process to share my workflow based on the resources I searched along the way.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a new <strong>EMPTY</strong> project (do not use “create website with Hugo”, because I found out you can’t view the website in your viewer this way).</li>
<li>Type blogdown::new_site() in the console.</li>
<li>Pick a them you like.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>choose a simple one at first. Your contents is more important than what fancy theme you pick and it’ll be also hard to de-bug if something goes wrong with your fancy them</li>
<li>copy the user/repo from the <strong>top left</strong> position in github homepage and paste in “theme=”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>use <strong>update_metadata</strong> addin to refresh all your updates on your homepage (the configuration in the config.toml).</li>
<li>use <strong>serve_site</strong> to render your post updates.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the statement in the output shows the address to open your blog. For example: ‘Serving the directory /Users/fanliu/Documents/Fan’s Blog at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5216" class="uri">http://127.0.0.1:5216</a>’</li>
<li>this blog helps to solve the problem that I created contents in my post but it couldn’t show up in the viewer:<a href="https://knausb.github.io/2017/06/a-first-post-using-blogdown/" class="uri">https://knausb.github.io/2017/06/a-first-post-using-blogdown/</a>. I really appreciate the author to share what he experienced.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To create a new post: blogdown::new_post(“test”, ext = getOption(“blogdown.ext”, “.Rmd”)). Use this extension argument to make it as Rmarkdown rather than default Markdown.</li>
</ol>
<p>So just use these 5 simple steps, you can create your own website! I took many detours to get here so hope this post can help you start your website much easier!</p>
