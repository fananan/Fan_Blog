<p>Need to fix markdown to Rmarkdown, otherwise you can’t write R code here…. okay, use this package DiagrammeR to draw flowcharts in R: <a href="https://datascienceplus.com/how-to-build-a-simple-flowchart-with-r-diagrammer-package/" class="uri">https://datascienceplus.com/how-to-build-a-simple-flowchart-with-r-diagrammer-package/</a> new data –&gt; identify key variables and check duplication (if pass) —&gt; do pre-process (if not pass) —&gt; pick a sample of dataset/examples to see what cause duplication</p>
<p>before presenting to others, take a short coffee break and come back to check the final data again with fresh eyes. Be careful, this is what you learned today 4/18: not just look at data but also pay attention to/be curious about weird numbers such as 0, negative values</p>
