These following workflows are all based on Windows version

## How to create a new repo for an existing project 
#### 1. Go to the directory that contains the existing project
#### 2. git init 
#### 3. git config --global user.name "Fan"
#### 4. git config --global user.email "fan..@.."
#### 5. git all . (if you want to add all files from the project or you can create git add .gitignore to include files that you don't want to track)
#### 6. git commit -m "message"
#### 7. git remote add origin repository directory
#### 8. ls -l (to check a list of files that will be commited to the repository)
#### 8. git push -u origin master 





## How to use Git branch:
This assumes that you already have created remote repository. 

#### 1. git clone
#### 2. git bash the place where the file you want to track is saved
#### 3. git branch branch-name
#### 4. git branch (to check available branches)
#### 5. git checkout branch-name (to switch branch)
#### 6. git branch
#### 7. git add . (create the file before this step)
#### 8. git status
#### 9. git commit -m "message"
#### 10. git push --set-upstream origin branch-name (to create same branch on remote repository)
* this is just used for the first time. Later on, you can just use "git push origin branch-name"

The second way to create branch:

#### 1. create a branch in your remote repository first
#### 2. clone this branch 
git clone git_url -- branch branch_name

#### 3. go to R file where you want to edit the code and git bash over there


## How to delete a file in repository:
scoring.R is the example

#### 1. git rm scoring.R
#### 2. git commit -m "remove scoring file"
#### 3. git push origin scoring 

## How to change the current repository path
#### 1. git remote -v (to check repository path)
#### 2. git remote remove origin 
#### 3. git remote add origin new-path
#### 4. git remote -v (to check again)

## How to exist the window "Please enter the commit message for your changes"
#### 1. Type a multi-line message to move forward with the commit
#### 2. Leave blank to abort the commit
#### 3. Hit "esc" then type ":wq" and hit enter. Viola!
