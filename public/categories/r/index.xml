      <description>This series of posts are inspired by my friends Mehrnaz and Anthi during a coffee chat.
The goal of your tech-related blogs should look like this format: http://r-statistics.co/Assumptions-of-Linear-Regression.html The first post will take you back to the basic assumptions about linear model and multicollinearity   Update on 8/19/2019: too much theoretical contents, you need some examples to illustrate your points… 1. Assumptions of Linear Model:  First thing first: why do we need to have assumptions: we don’t need them to fit least sqaured model, but violating the assumptions will make yourself more difficult in interpreting the regression results, for example, constructing a confidence interval.</description>

      <description>The simple workflow to get started with Blogdown I always want to start my own blog. I tried Medium because I really liked their simple neat interface, but the only thing it lacks of is the function to let me embed code in my article. Later I found blogdown and got excited to use it, but I almost gave up because I encounted few trivial problems. So I would like to share what I learned through this process to share my workflow based on the resources I searched along the way.</description>
