      <description>This series of posts are inspired by my friends Mehrnaz and Anthi during a coffee chat.
Quick Overview of Comparing Defining Features between GLM and Linear regression (reference):  Linear Regression (ANOVA, ANCOVAâ€¦) Residuals of dependent variable are normally distributed All coefficient estimates, means, residual variance are calculated by OLS (ordinary least squares).
