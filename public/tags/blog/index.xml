      <description>The simple workflow to get started with Blogdown I always want to start my own blog. I tried Medium because I really liked their simple neat interface, but the only thing it lacks of is the function to let me embed code in my article. Later I found blogdown and got excited to use it, but I almost gave up because I encounted few trivial problems. So I would like to share what I learned through this process to share my workflow based on the resources I searched along the way.</description>
